# Milkomeda WSC Contributions

> **If you plan on working on a significant feature, please open an issue and ask before you get started.**

Before starting any development work on ConnectKit please take some time to review this document.

## Develop

Before jumping into any code, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16 or higher

Then simply clone the repository to your computer like following:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:dcspark/milkomeda-wsc-ui-react.git
$ cd milkomeda-wsc-ui-react
```

and install the dependencies and run the bundler:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run dev:milkomeda-wsc-ui-react # Start the bundler
```

Depending on how you'd like to develop and test ConnectKit there are a couple of different environments you can fire up (you can see them in `package.json`). These environments double as simple code examples of how to get ConnectKit set up.

```sh
# In Create React App
$ npm run dev:cra

```

If the above environments do not fit your needs, feel free to create a new one.
